Heres a single, to add, to Kindle. Just read this 19th century story: "The Ghost of Round Island". Its about a man (French/American Indian) and his dog sled transporting a woman across the ice, from Mackinac Island to Cheboygan - and the ghost that...

Ghost of Round Island is supposedly nonfiction.
Why is Barnes and Nobles version of the Kindle so much more expensive than the Kindle?
Meh. I think Singles are a bad idea. Big name authors already dominate the market by a huge factor. Now you are letting them compete on price point with indie authors (albeit giving less content for the money).
I am not sure if i just got my update but now i dont have location numbers unless i press the menu button.  But i also dont have page numbers! Am i doing something wrong?
Not a fan of Kindle Singles.  They clog up the Kindle Book page and its tough to sort through full-legnth new releases because there are so, so many Singles there.
What is a single?
Its just too bad you arent offering these for the Original Kindle.  Seems like those of us who got on your bandwagon first are just left in the dust.
AND Then There IS www.amazon.com/Circumstantial-Evidence-Getting-Florida-Bozarth-ebook/dp/B004FPZ452/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_1  CAN You Solve this Mystery.  Get your Copy TODAY on Amazon for Kindle
you arent missing a thing, I tried this game and it sucks!
I have a couple games on my kindle...only problem is my family seems to think I put them on there for them...
why dont you make it free? Its not all about money you know...
So let me get this straight...Kindle is now a gaming device?  Dont jump the shark Kindle...please dont!
True Anders...although they are in it for the money:) Otherwise they wouldnt be in existence.
Can we play these games on the kindle app on ipad?
Is that right? Only the original Kindle? What about the 2nd generation?
Are there any stand-alone interactive fiction (text adventure) games? I know there are some online ones but I dont have 3g and Id like to play away from wifi.
Kindle is a book... Stop making it into somthing its not...leave the games to other moble devices...
I play Triple Town its fun...if you dont want the games, dont get them!
How does the kindle having an "OPTION" to download and play games on it ruin the experience of your Kindle? Complaining about it doesnt make any sense.
Yes De ra you can get it on the iPad. I just bought it.
um,how how do you play this on the kindle?
You can play it on the original. I just downloaded it for 99 cents
Its harder to play because you dont have color. Just pretend 
OK I bit
kindle just 4 months old and went kaput!  wont turn on
Call customer service and they will replace it immediately no questions asked.
@Fitzwater Gale - No one has color on their Kindle.
old school kindle 4 life
My kindle is one of my most prized possessions
Just wish I had more time to read for pleasure..not just for school
Clara not all books can be gotten on kindle but you can check them out on Amazon.
I stay up reading now til my eyes just wont stay open! <3 my kindle!
Just dropped my quality medical mystery to 99 cents for kindle just to show that price has nothing to do with quality writing. Title is Floaters, not to be confused with Joe Konraths or Joe Waumgauhs Floaters.
I really like the Kindle. Difficult to write sentences and use some word games due to the tiny letters. Overall, the Kindle is wonderful.
Thanks @John Zaffino
i bet theres a book to download for that...
Yesterday / When my Kindle seemed so far away ...
Suddenly / Waiting time is half of what it used to be
I have a Kindle. Dont you want one too?If you get a kindle, Ill share my books with you!
I lovingly refer to my Kindle as my "Crackle" because its so addictive!
not to many Men ?????????
I just ordered a waterproof cover! Yay!
Anyone know what "EVERY WORD" is..and is it free?
How about lending or access to the local library?
How about lending or access to the local library?
Ok Robert Walker send your book!
Why can I not get Water for Elephants on my Kindle in Canada?????
It is my strange addiction!  I cant put it down.
I should have signed Phyllis, the Kindle was a gift to Peter from our daughters for his birthday in Oct. I read the first book and havent stopped since. My husband said my wife perfers to go to bed with her Kindle instead of me he he. Phyllis
I just bought that book and 2 more of your books
I know what took it so long?
Me too!
Me too!
I do know how to do that!
Me and my Kindle strolling down the avenue =o)
My kindle froze and when I rebooted everything in my archives was gone. Is that a problem from that last update? :(
@Kathy..ty for the response..Ill look into it:)
I have the 2nd generation but am thinking of getting the new one. Thoughts???
Im gonna gag. 
How do you download and play games on Kindle? I didnt know you could do this!
louise - you buy them from the amazon store. Theyre currently only available in the us which leaves the rest of the world waiting
No
ebooks not snooks.
And then you could download it to your Kindle and listen to it!
I would love to love a Kindle but it needs to be library ebook friendly first :(
I like my Kindle but miss having a backlight so I can read in the dark. Also, I use my eyes all day at a computer so lately Ive been doing a lot more audio books on my smartphone.
My kindles screen has disappeared actually only the top half. I miss it dearly> (
It happened right after the update>
Read on my kindle. Thats what I do.
There are a lot of things in this world I could live without.  My Kindle doesnt happen to be one of them!

Thanks for posting the lists. Read-a-palooza for me! Im getting some of them NOW =)
Amazon Kindle supplies right here:http://www.babcockpublishing.com/ezbuy/index.htm#Kindle
99 cents gets you medical examiner novel FLOATERS....2.99 gets you historical thriller CHILDREN of SALEM....3.99 gets you TITANIC 2012 - Curse of RMS Titanic (historical & Science Fic. in one)
How about reduced prices on kindle books , for Kindle Owners, say once a month!
@Annette.  I agree.  It really makes me angry when the Kindle book is more than the actual book.  I refuse to buy either.  That is the ONLY problem that I have with Amazon.  It is something they should adjust immediately.
Too bad I cant open this link on my Kindle.
And my book: ALOHA RAINBOW.
Try The Hangmans Daughter !
Thanks for posting this! I found me 5 freebies!!!!
checked it out last night - downloaded at least a dozen more titles!
Alladin, duh
could not get the new download to download....
Most public libraries lend e-books; however, the libraries format is NOT compatible with the Amazon Kindle.  Big bummer!
I read at least 3 books a week so the free books are wonderful.  If iI find it boring after a chapter or two, I delete it and get another.  Since it was free I dont feel bad about deleting.
KINDLE KEEPS ROCKING, I KEEP READING.
This is going to be dangerous to my credit card, isnt it?
Yep, its totally doable to download books to your computer than transfer to the Kindle via the USB cable.  People without wireless coverage have been doing it all along.  Directions are in the Kindle Users Guide.Also, folks who think Kindle book prices should be lower should talk to the publishers - theyre the ones who set the prices, especially the higher ones (youll note that on many books its noted that "This price was set by the publisher").
i am reading aesop fables
Sent!
Now, if we could just have collections inside of collections, I would be ecstatic!
Do you know how to put an item back into archives and get it off the Droid?  I cant find this info anywhere.  :(
Now thats a great tip! Ive picked some books that were bloody awful which I was hoping to never catch sight of again!
Thank you. I wondered about this but was too lazy to research the answer!
To read epub books for nook etc just download calibre free ebook management program online to your PC which will convert them to mobi or tzw for kindle. ..(Blaine Z. Author of "The Gaines Agenda" and "Weight Loss on your Nook or Kindle " available on nook.com
I use this feature, have a collection of classics I read with my homeschool students, and one for different genres just for myself.  Keeps me down to 2 pages rather than 18 or so.
Thanks for that tip, I knew there HAD to be a way to do it but I was at a loss as to how.
Melodie - how are you moving them? Do you use the 5-way thing to hilite "add to collection" and then choose the collection? Thats the way I do it and the book always disappears from home and only appears in the collection.
I have the same issue as Melodie...
@Melodie - at the top of your screen, you need to tell it to sort by collections.  Not by author, or most recent, or whatever.
@ Frances - you should be able to click left when its highlighted and that should give you the option to delete.
Thanks!
@Ann - to remove from my droid I just press and hold on the book title until a box opens and it will have some options.  One is to remove from device.  Hope this helps you!
I have trouble getting things back into archive. Anyone know if I can keep both Kindles linked to the same Amazon account, but only have books go to one of them and not archive in the other? I want to get some stuff that my 14 year old son doesnt want/need in his archive and vice versa.
Any idea how to put a nook on the kindle from my computer? I have one on a disc into the computer and want to put on my kindle. How?? 
Wish I could manage collections from Manage My Kindle and from Kindle for PC.
Finally!  Thanks!

Can I have a collection of collections ? May be I should try it myself first ?
- Home page by CollectionUse your five way button move the cursor to the top of you home screen hit the right directional button and sort your Home page by Collection.  This will allow your Kindle to only display your books once (Collections & books on Home page).  When you enter a collection you will only be shown the books in that collection.
and what if the book you want to perm delete doesnt show up in "your orders"?  anyone else have this issue?
- Karen, Im guessing you mean book and not nook.  The nook and the Kindle dont interface.For a book, use your USB cable that came with the Kindle and attach it to you computer and reader.  Assuming here that you have a PC go to My Computer folder on your desktop and you should see a Kindle icon as if it was a USB flash drive or some other type of attached device.  Select the Kindle supported file(s) you have in your PC and drop them on the icon.  The files are now on your Kindle.
The big question is, how do I get rid of the samples once Ive bought the book?
The nook :(       the kindle :)
My Kindle is charged, but when I try to turn it on the green light comes on for a few seconds but will not come on. I just got this in Sept. New edition Kindle.
Thanks,  I was wondering!
but how do I put into the archives when I am done reading?  no one has been able to answer me that.
How come this Does Not work for ALL books?  I still have 5 stuck on my kindle in Arcives grrrr
@Theri I have the same problem and cant figure it out either. The older books are archived but are not listed anywhere when I go online to manage your kindle. They do not show up at all. 
To delete a sample after purchasing the book:  highlight the sample on the Home page, rift select with the 5-way and select delete.  This permanently deleted the sample.
OMG! I just had a friend do this for me because I didnt have time to look it up. Kinda scary... are you monitoring me Kindle? Are you going to rule the world through mind reading? ;-) Im calling for govt restrictions here *tongue-in-cheek* Im really tired...
Thanks.  Ive been wondering about how to do that...
My kindle just received some type of update. Anyone know what this is?
I wanna know how to move something TO the archived items....???
thanks for the tip  i know there had to be way
doesnt work on all files...
Yeah same problem here, it leaves some kind of link to the title you place in a collection, but I dont think two actual copies are stored, but access to same book via main menu and the collection you really wish it would show up and no where else!! : )  still love ya, Kindle!  ; )
Fml I never knew what collections were for.  And I actually read the while PDF on my kindle, lol
If youve deleted a book through the Manage Your Kindle page and its still in your Archives, its probably because you havent turned on wireless since you deleted.  Your Kindle wont know its been permanently deleted until it can "talk to the mothership".
how about when you delete from "Manage your kindle" and they still show up on the kindle???  I called Amazon this week - tech had no clue - deregistered my kindle and re-registered - told me hed look into it and call me back - its been almost a week - no call or anything.  I LOVE my Kindle, but its annoying to want something gone and cant get rid of it.
I saw the other day on FB we were to get a download when it went into sleep mode  -  if I did - no clue as to how/what or where.
Does anyone still read the original Kindle?  I still really like mine although I dont think I can play games on it.  Thats what the computer is for!
My Kindle just got the upgrade, yippee! Page numbers at last!
to Janice, you should have received an email about the update with a link to detailed instructions.
Lori W.M. - Ive had this problem too!  I deleted titles from "Manage your Kindle" and not only did they continue to show up in my archived items, still available to download, but when I purchased a new Kindle, the deleted title showed up in my archives there too!  When I installed Kindle for PC, the deleted title again showed up in my archives.  The deleted title is no longer showing in "Manage your Kindle" but it wont go away from my archives!  Yuck!  Am I stuck forever with a bad story that I would rather forget?
That deletes it from the account too? :| I was just trying to get rid of stuff from the device.. Crap.
Agreed collections contain books, but the books are also contained outside of the collection folders, what then is the point of making a collection in the first place.  
- Robyn CombsIf you look at the bottom of your Kindle there is a small hole.  This is a microphone, it is mentioned in the Users Manual.  Ill let you figure out the rest of the answer to your question.
I love my Kindle, but I really wish there was a way to manage my collections from the PC - its very tedious and time-consuming fiddling around with the buttons on the Kindle itself.
I also have the same problem of deleted books still showing up in the archived items....and I have had my Kindle turned on wi-fi since they were deleted.
1 is a sample No I dont want the book!  The others were free books I dont want. YES I had my WiFi on!  I tried EVERYTING to get rid of these books!
Thanks, thats just what Id been trying to find out how to do.
Sabah Farheen Hasan,  you have your books in the wrong order.  If you go to the home page and with the five way go up to the very top it will come up and say "Title, Author, Collections and Most Recent First", if you put the highlight under Collections then the books will only show up in the collections.  Hope that helps!!!
To the person who wanted audio books, you have already got them.  If you are in your book and you push the change font button it will show you a few different things and one of those things is called "text to speech" , most of our books are enabled to have this all you have to do is turn it on!! Hope I didnt just confuse you more!!!
? how to move something to the archived items list?
OK I did all this and the books r still in my Archive-I want them outa there -they r gone from my orders section on amazon but still in my kindle -they didnt go away-Why??
So how do you delete a document you have sent to your kindle?
Why not just have a bin folder and put all unwanted books in there and dont look at them again after all the kindle holds 3500 books. Forget the ones you dont want and spend your time on the ones you do want 
One evening I forgot my Kindle at the office andI had to read one of my 1900 plus books. Do you believe that I needed two hands to turn the pages?
Helen that Sounds ok But who wants Clutter on their eReader....Not me!  Thanks all....even tho didnt work!
All of my books disappeared completely.  Is there a way to get them back?
All of my books disappeared completely.  Is there a way to get them back?
I <3 this sleeve. I have the green variant for my Kindle.
I MADE myself a cover  and it sure dint cost me 20 bucks!  An being that I am a HORSE person ,  it has horses  of course!
Still cant believe that I won this sleeve in the sweepstakes and received it in the mail within days. Thanks, Amazon.
Does anyone know of a sleeve that can fit the Kindle latest generation with the Kindle lighted cover in it? I put it in my purse and crumbs or dirt can still get in or on the kindle!! Thanks!
I want 1!!!!!!!  <3
I use this; it works for me.  I throw it in my backpack.
I have it and the flap is too big. Kind of pricey.
I think $30 is about $20 too much.
Just buy a Belkin.  Its the same thing, but with a zipper.  I bought mine at Target for around $20.
@David Noooo kidding.  You would think that competition would bring the price down to earth.
I can probably sew one of these! Thanks for the idea!
whats wrong with Amazons Own cover??
No offense but all the sleeves for this product are a bit ugly.   Cant beat my lighted green leather case!
Was trying to manually download updates and had to call your service for help! The guy was inpatient-bordering on rude, could NOT understand him! I told him I was having trouble understanding what he was saying! I finally got the problem solved but next time I will hang up until I get someone that speaks ENGLISH!!
I won one of these and its really nice!  Too bad I actually own a 2nd generation Kindle that wont fit in it.
Amen. Same thing happened to me twice. If I wanted to speak another language I would move. Its aggravating when something is not working, then to have to try to understand someone else try to explain how to fix it, not speak English.

Send me 1!!!
I have one and dig it.
Can not buy it in Canada?
ok...  how do I get rid of this now?  No idea how it got there, no idea how to remove it.  Im not an advert!
Please remove. From my facebook thx
Just ordered mine!
I have the larger version for the DX - the one major complaint is that the velcro is a bit loud when opening.  Otherwise, its great.
Own this. Live it
I have 3 covers - dress kindle to match my purse!
but are they made in America?
If you dont want to see these messages on your FB wall, go back to the Amazon Kindle page, scroll down and click on "Unlike".  You have to do it yourself.
I just bought the lime one!!!
Can not understand why we in Canada can not buy these book covers some dumb excuse about the boarder. Funny one can buy just about anything without any trouble. What the h gives.???
A friend just got me a "Tuf Luv" case for my Kindle! Read all about it! Stands the Kindle up in 3 positions so you can read it hands free! Neat!
Are they coming out with one for the DX in the Kindle cover???
I saw patterns to sew your own on Clotildes website.
$24.99 for a fabric sleeve??? This should be $10. I bet these cost $1 to make if not less.
I use a bubble wrap postage envelope, $0.79, though mine is repurposed and thus free!
Give me one please~
Why cant you ship these covers to B.C.?
OMG....I cant believe how much of a tool you are!
hehe
I do that too.
Boo to Who Views Your Profile.
I love to read, but hate lugging a book around (mine are usually the BIG ones), hate losing my bookmark, losing my place in the reading, and forgetting to bring another book if Im about done with the current one! And, sometimes time restraints can make getting to the book store a hassle.Now that my sweetheart got me a Kindle, I dont have to worry about any of that anymore!! :) I LOVE IT!!!
Since Christmas day, I have read 23 books on my Kindle...
I have fibromyalgia and RA, so when I want to read before bed, I can grab my Kindle and read with no pain in my hands.
Thats partly why we got ours! Expecting #2 in 5 weeks, and Im planning on reading one-handed while settling, breastfeeding, etc!
Me, too!
Did you get your update yet??
I do that too 
sew did Charles Darwin, read his Autobiography, before Amazon uses all the HARDCOPY for Kindle
I wish I wouldve had mine when my baby was nursing; it wouldve made reading MUCH simpler and wouldve allowed me to do more than sit there completely bored when I was trying to minimize noise and keep it dark for middle-of-the-night feedings.
I do this with my son all the time.
What built in light??? Thats my only complaint!! 
When Im fussy and unable to sleep (which, with stress, is often), I have my Kindle read to me! So much better than reading and putting down the book before Im truly ready to sleep.
Get a kindle, download books instead of buying them.....SAVE A TREE!
How can i make the contrast darker on my kindle?
I have been trying to figure out a way to read a book and walk on my treadmill.  Voila -- the Kindle makes it possible.  Now, if I read my Kindle while walking the time passes so quickly -- Im not ready to get off the treadmill so quickly, I always have to read one more page, then one more again and so on.
I did the samething with my Grandaughter
I adore my Kindle. But I think its a pity Amazon dont disclose at purchase time the fact that they are going to refuse to see kindle books to non-American customers. In my country this would be misleading and deceptive conduct.
those annoying babies just insisting on being held! how selfish of them.
im not in American and can download books with no problems, and so can my friends
I love my kindle, but... why cant a person hold a fussy baby with a book?  Two kids, one who refused to sleep unless held, a good 10 years before the kindle.
Hard copy til the day I die. That way books I paid for wont disappear from my library on someones whim ;)I refuse to pay for things that I dont truly own.
Me too!! Oh the joys of mommyhood ;-)
Dave, your old fashioned attitude is to your own detriment....but I guess thats your choice! Why are you making comment on this post - you have to like kindle in order to do so??? How strange!
I dont know why but I read faster with the kindle
I ordered mine on Monday morning, cant wait!!
Thats what I do!!
My kindle is a real keeper!
I wish I would have had one back in the day!!!
Yes me too.  I wish Id had a Kindle while I was flying solo on fussy baby nights.  :)
I agree, though sometimes she wakes up and asks me if I want to go antiquing tomorrow.
And she couldnt hold a paper book? Huh?!
My left arm is messed up from an accident (I am left handed). I practically had to give up reading which always has been my favorite pastime. Holding any book, keeping the pages opened hurt my arm really bad, it would ache and burn all the way up to my shoulder. Then one day I bought myself a Kindle and reading is no longer a pain. No more book to have to keep open, I dont even have to hold it. Yes, it is much different than holding onto a paperback
KINDLE ROCKS THE CRADLE!!
When I am on a crowded San Diego trolley I can hold on with one hand and hold on to my Kindle with the other and read!
My Kindle (which I got last Xmas) just went to Prague with me! It helps pass the time in the long airplane ride!
When I am on my treadmill and cant hear TV because I am deaf, I can read my Kindle because I dont have turn hold a book and turn pages.  Makes the 30 minutes fly by.
I did the same thing yesterday!! could never do that with a book.
Wish I had my kindle when my children were babies!
Who cares about a short power outage..I have my Kindle book light to show me the way in the dark......
I do exactly the same thing... or play Every Word"
My big issue is the grade of plastic used....it cracks without being forced in any way. Love Amazon for the gift vouchers and replacement though!
You could also read a book. Dont get me wrong, I love my Kindle.
do that all the time
Haha! I loved reading through these comments! I think what everyone is getting at - is that the Kindle shouldnt replace hard copy books entirely - it just provides a level of useflness that outdoes hard-copy books, hands down! Jogging on the treadmill, holding a baby, at the beach/in the water with a protective case, and then all the places and situations you could still read a regular book, but instead, youve got your WHOLE library, in 10oz and in one hand. Oh, not to mention you can bookmark, highlight, add notes, and you have a BUILT IN dictionary -- and you dont have to defile your book like you would your hard copy to put notes and highlights in. Hands down, the Kindle is better. How can anyone say it isnt better, when I can take my entire library, including my personal documents converted for free using my Kindle email/conversion process, everywhere I go - with a 3 week battery. I challenge anyone to carry your whole library with you for 3 weeks. Hehehehe!
Trying hard to save to get one!
Why read a kindle forum/ fb page if you dont like or dont want a kindle?? Yes there r pros and cons for paper books and e books, but this is the KINDLE facebook site - if ur against kindle/ e book readers why r u bothering with this site?? Is it me??! 
My oldest granddaughter saw a new paperback I just bought and asked "what is this? I thought you only read your Kindle." I laughed and told her it depended on price and which I could get cheaper. 
I am there
My Kindle goes to the Dr.s office(when we have to wait long periods of time), on road trips, to conferences, everywhere I go except work (I am so addicted I would not get much work done). It is lightweight and I can read it in brightest sun or by lamplight.
I have a problem with my kindle.  The top third of the screen is distorted and I cant read anything on the top third.  What happended?
My Kindle makes using the treadmill bearable!
The same is true when your cat wants some petting and you want to do a little reading.
Not to mention the space it saves in small homes.
man, is there anything kindle CANT do?
How ironic! I was just using that today! 
Ive gotten so used to this feature that I instinctively search for it when reading a normal printed book. And then I think "Aww shoot".
another reason to get a kindle it seems.
Thanks for the tip, I just got my Kindle today...
I luv the Kindle, but the reality of the dictionary is that when it is really needed it is useless. A native English speaker should need it for the most esoteric words, and they are the very ones about which the dictionary stays mum.
If only.the kindle was back lit!

Waiting impatiently to receive mine!!
I <3 that feature!!!
Just tried it. Thanks for the tip. 
any way to use this feature on the Kindle for Android Ap?
weirdly, I cannot get this feature to work if the word in question is the first one on the left hand margin side of the page.
...ours has been freezing up...???
When Im reading a physical book, there is often an embarrassing moment as I realize (after my thumb has already shifted on the page) that Im not reading my Kindle, and therefore cannot use the built-in dictionary.
This feature is the number one feature which has spoiled me. I seriously miss it when I read a paper book.
whoa!
@rick what edition.  The older ones when they do that need to get rid of if newer contact amazon they will replace!!! Im buying my second one thats what 1st edition did wearing out. I read every day!!!! Use a lot.  But thats what amazon told me.
I use this feature often!!
I use both dictionaries..if definition is not in the standard, then I switch to the Oxford. Also, use my Kindle to look up word definitions when reading paper books.
Can u do this with the kindle app on galaxy tab?
My Kindle makes me feel smart.  I am forever looking using the built in dictionary.  Every time I stumble across an unknown word, I have to find out the meaning.  Love my Kindle -
adoro mi kindle es mi nuevo juguete jajajaja
@ Rick, mine kept freezing up and I turn mine off or put it to sleep each time I need to put it down.  I also make sure it is fully charged each day.  I know I probably need to send it in but I dont want to give it up to do  so. :)
Am not able to change my fonts for some reason.  Cant get to that option, anyone have a clue why that would be?
I wish I could manage all my books on the Amazon site instead of having to remove each book one by one!
This feature is so useful... I am so fond of it that sometimes, while reading a physical book or brochure I try to use it then miss it and wish it was there...
@Melody are you reading a PDF file?
On the iPhone you just touch and hold your finger on the word and the def pops up, Im guessing it would be the same on the android.
@Karen, yes you can do in on the original Kindles. You have to scroll the wheel up to the row where the word you want defined is, then push the scroll button. It will show you the definition for all the words on that row. 
Thanks for this tip!!!  Did not know that!!!
I  downloaded the Bible on my Kindle, at the suggestion of my son.  Now I have one less thing to carry.
Learn something everyday
It comes in SO handy!!
뭥미??
Sometimes the definition is at the top of the screen. Depends on where the word being defined is located on the page.
@Barbara Evans, send the email to NAME@free.kindle.com instead of NAME@kindle.com to not be charged. I know theres some way to get Amazon to convert PDFs instead of just send them, but I cant seem to find it. I always use a software program called Calibre when I need to convert documents.
I still havent been able to archive my books when finished reading.  Any suggestions, Kindle users?
Ann- for archiving I made a collection and called it "Read". That way I keep track of books and know where Im up to, especially when reading a series. Or you could just delete it from your Kindle and it will be archived on your Amazon account for retrieval at a later date should you so wish. 
Built-in dictionary support is great but... You need to move cursor to the next world again through all page if popup definition is not enough and you need to jump to full world definition: select word - read popup - not enough - jump to full definition - return to page - current selection disappeared - move cursor from beginning of page to next word etc.Another discomfort: if page contains link to footnote, you need to move cursor to link through all page with accompanying word definitions popup. Too annoying :(Kindle need to have different page navigations for word definitions and links
This is the feature I use the most on my Kindle.  Dont skip a word you dont know.  Read the definition immediately to get more understanding from the passage.
I just keep hitting back button to get back to the page I was reading.
Can someone please tell me if you can read your Kindle in the dark?  Does it have internal lighting like reading on the IPhone does? I looked at the Nook and it does not and I need that feature. 
Diane,All E_Inc books (AFAIR) does not have built-in lighting (or illumitation). You need to buy cover with built-in light or stand-alone light.
Thats why I chose Kindle!
Thanks for the tip. I will be using this one!!
If Kindle could reach out and taser those bothering me while I read, that will be a good app.
Ann light,  when you finish reading book remove book from device,it will automatically be archived when you remove the book
Didnt know that thanks.
Easily my fav feature among many. Kindle simply rocks
Thanks for the info on archiving--Diane: re reading the Kindle in the dark: there is a cover that is lighted which you can purchase from amazon.
Please make a Ukrainian dictionary!
^ Spam.
wow that was rude!! 
Does Amazon have a program to donate Kindles to developing countries?
i think thats the point... so they can learn to read...
AMAZON - you need to get the junk off from here.  I know not to click on these links, but others might not.  Bunch of idiots.  As for India - they have most of our businesses now - not in favor of sending them anything.  Sorry!
Report PROFILE VIEWS TRACKER as spam so we dont have to put up with this all the time!
lets make them solar powered first
Oh a solar powered Kindle would be great!!  Not only for developing countries but for our own too!!  Can you imagine not having to worry about losing the charger cable ever again???
Send my son a Kindle and load his school books on it to relieve his frame of carrying home 20 pounds of books and binder daily.
Seriously Margaret? Do we just assume now that anyone in the ghettos of the world a.k.a "developing countries" cant read? As if your capitalized sentence didnt ooze sarcasm. How could you think that wasnt rude?
@Karen God forbid your son should have to exorcise a bit. They want to give Kindles do people who have NOTHING and youre complaining about your son you want to be obese.
Unfortunately I agree with Karen on the overly heavy schoolbooks comment, however they make Kindle formats of many textbooks now, so hopefully that will alleviate that stress soon.  As for sending Kindles to the modernizing world I believe it would be a great idea in theory and probably a horrible idea in practice.  I also believe there are greater concerns in those countries that we need to tackle first before sending them Kindles.
@ C.j.:  Because that is what I do professionally...working for programs that teach illiterate adults here and abroad.  And in the developing countries, most of the adults are functionally illiterate--not their fault.  The capitalized sentence wasnt to "ooze sarcasm" at the people, but at the idea we can send technology and it will all magically be better.  Trust me on this:  learning to read as an adult is hard work, and only happens with lots of work by the teachers/tutors and the students.
@ John Tapley carrying books around causing back issues has nothing to do with exercise. If doing so made kids less fat, then why would there be fat youths still? Get over yourself. Textbooks on kindles would be great. Not so great for irresponsible kids (which is nearly all of them)

Not just developing countries. 25% of the American population is functionally illiterate. We have highschool graduates who can not read their diplomas. Does it get worse than that?
Id rather send comdoms.....or the pill
Exactly right, Dragana.
Stop buying textbooks for kids in school. Give them Kindles.
Wait ....Bri...we can go on fb on the kindle...I need to find a kid for a lesson
AGREE!!!
Ive gotten almost that good of a reaction with my Kindle 1 at my husbands eye specialists office. Someone with very limited vision has their world opened again with the font changing option. I have been a walking advertisement several times personally. Kindle needs to direct advertise to ophthalmologists!
How about sending this USA struggling author a Kindle? My book is available, on it, and I cannot see it.
Its a shame all the negative garbage back and forth just because a decent person wrote an article about his vision to help other people. That was a great article! There is way too much tearing things apart instead of looking at the intent of the article.
need to know how to SHARE books??????
Create source of income first jackass how do u propose they pay for the books the wanna read when they can hardly afford food.these people are dining from hunger and thirst and u wanna give them a kindle your effing sick if u see kids in rags traveling miles away so they can have drinking water and your first thought is to give them a kindle.
I bought a Bible for $1.99 We send Bibles to Russian schools  and we cant even pray in schools. CONDOMS....spelling!
@ Dave kolan Im embarrassed for you... Perpetuate their own poverty? Dude no comment...
Cant we send them Ipod touches and Kindles both?
Rashean... you are a great example of why people need books."Create source of income first jackass how do u propose they pay for the books the wanna read when they can hardly afford food.these people are dining from hunger and thirst and u wanna give them a kindle your effing sick if u see kids in rags traveling miles away so they can have drinking water and your first thought is to give them a kindle"Create (a) source of income first jackass(.)

might have a point but what revolution would come from reading the classics?
@Judy: loaning books on kindle is available. Go to your amazon account, manage your account, check the books listed and see which ebooks are available to loan not all are. They will be a box by each of the book titles that you will have click on that will read if the ebook can be loaned out. Then just follow the rest.   
I live in Africa! You can send me a Kindle!
Do you have an office in India?
Katie, regarding your correction and comments above, I guess you didnt realize that "your effing sick" should actually be "youre", not just capitalized.  And I believe the phrase is "poverty stricken" not "poverty struck".
Some disgusting comments on this post! "I would rather send condoms or the pill!" uh I think America and the Uk could benefit from those also looking at the single teen pregnancies, but our kids still have access to the kindle! Come on guys....Grow up please! 
i <3 my Kindle ^_^
Skvělý stroj... !!!
I still miss that catchy jingle from the original ad.
long live the kindle!
Gimme a break - who the hell runs smiling this way with a Kindle?
same, my kindle is everything to me, im on it more than my ipod or laptop at times.
I love my Kindle, though the publishing industry seems dead set on killing it off with their idiotic pricing schemes.
El mejor regalo tecnológico que he adquirido en el último año...de verdad lo recomiendo a todos mis amigos...
I read more with my Kindle than I have in years

mmm No esto no es un iPad, es un libro; No tampoco es una compu, es un libro; No no tiene juegos, es un libro; Si tiene wi-fi, si tiene conectividad 3g gratis en todo el mundo de por vida, Si se pueden leer los libros que bajas de internet, no no tienes que comprárselos a AMAZON si no quieres. Si, se pueden meter dentro de este libro electrónico miles de libros digitales. Si se pueden leer los .doc .pdf etc convirtiéndolos con una herramienta muy muy simple de usar.
Now, if the Kindle just had expandable memory...
Throw it my purse and go. Have my whole library,some games, docs, and basic web for referencing at my fingure tips for when ever I need it!
Love my Kindle too! Would be lost without it..
Nice!  I cringed a bit when the people were balancing on fences and leaping around holding their Kindles...Id call that living dangerously!
I heart my kindle!!!
I was reading with it for around 8 hours yesterday and the battery is hardly even drained.  <3 my Kindle!
develop a way to share books!  that is a big drawback.  I love my kindle but hate that I cant share books as easily as I did before.
